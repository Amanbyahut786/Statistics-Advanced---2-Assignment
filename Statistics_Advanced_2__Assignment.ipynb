        "   * Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population. It's a formal procedure to test a claim or hypothesis about a population parameter.\n",

        "###* It typically involves the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "###1. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
        "* The null hypothesis ($H_0$$H_0$) is a statement of no effect or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$$H_1$) is the statement you are trying to find evidence for.\n",

        "* This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Commonly used values are 0.05 or 0.01.\n",

        "* This is a value computed from the sample data that is used to evaluate the hypothesis.\n",
        "###5. Determine the p-value:\n",
        "* This is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "###6. Make a decision:\n",
        "* Compare the p-value to the significance level ($\\alpha$$\\alpha$). If the p-value is less than or equal to $\\alpha$$\\alpha$, you reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
